# Realm Trials
In response to the booming gaming industry and the rise of E-Sports, this project embarks
on the creation of a multi-environment competitive speed-running video game by utilizing the
capabilities of the modern gaming engine, Unreal Engine 5, Motivated by the industry's
exponential growth, the accessibility of open-source development engines, and the underrepresentation of Arab developers, our endeavor seeks to contribute a unique perspective to the
global gaming landscape.<br>
Our overarching goal is to provide players with a multidimensional gaming experience, seamlessly
transitioning between diverse environments and testing their skills across various gaming aspects
and making them fight for the highest positions on global leaderboards. Motivated by the industry's

across various gaming aspects and making them fight for the highest positions on global
leaderboards.<br>
Through this project, we aspire to make a competitive speed-running game that features 3 different
environments (Shooter, Racer and Combat) each environment will test the playerâ€™s skill in a certain
aspect of their gaming skill to see how they stack up against other players, The prototype we aim
to deliver in this project is a game as a proof of concept that contains three different environments
each with unique levels that the players can compete in to achieve the best completion times, which
will be posted on global leaderboards.<br>
This project will be implemented using the power of the modern open-source game engine, Unreal
Engine, following a waterfall, step-by-step process to deliver our project, On the completion of
our prototype, we expect to have a working concept of our game released on Steam where
anyone around the world can download and compete with the others.
